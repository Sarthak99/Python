**Welcome to the Blockchain project !!**  
This project has the basic components of [building a blockchain in python](https://github.com/Sarthak99/Python/blob/master/Blockchain/blockchain.py), [creating an hypothetical cryptocurrency](https://github.com/Sarthak99/Python/blob/master/Blockchain/satocoins.py) and [smart contracts]() in a blockchain.


### Build a basic blockchain
Before we start off with the implementation of the blockchain, it is required to have some basic knowledge in python and a fundamental understanding of the blockchain. There will be code frgaments shown and linked below that will explain the working structure of this particular blockchain.  

**!!_Documentation in progress_!!**
